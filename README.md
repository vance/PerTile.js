Multi-Resolution Periodic Tile Engine


foreverscape-engine
The ForeverScape is a massive 2.3 football field long hand-drawn illustration that tiles like wallpaper (every page connects to the next). This is a javascript implementation that allows users to explore the ForeverScape universe. Use it as a re-sizable component and add optional interactivity features through the interaction and scripting API.

This is in early development...
